What's plac?

* plac started out as a command-line arguments parser written on top
  of argparse. 

* plac evolved into a general purpose tool to define
  command-oriented domain specific languages (DSLs). 

* it can be used as a replacement of the cmd module in the standard 
  library.

* it can be used to script applications and to automatize functional
  tests 

* and much more

This talk will touch upon many use cases where plac can make your 
life as a developer simpler and better. plac works with all Python 
versions from 2.3 to 3.2 (more or less).
